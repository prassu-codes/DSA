## Problem

### Distance between two nodes

Given an undirected connected tree with  **N**  nodes, numbered from  **1**  to  **N**, and rooted at node  **1**, and two nodes $u$ and $v$, find the distance between these two nodes. (**Note:**  the distance between two nodes is the no. of edges in the simple path between them.)

For example, in the following tree, the distance between nodes $3$ and $7$ is $4$.

### Input Format
- The first line of the input contains three space separated integers $N$, $u$ and $v$ — the number of nodes, and two given nodes.
- The next $N - 1$ lines describe the edges. The $i$-th of these $N - 1$ lines contains two space-separated integers $u_i$ and $v_i$, denoting a bidirectional edge between $u_i$ and $v_i$.
### Output Format
- Output on the single line, the distance between the nodes $u$ and $v$.
### Constraints
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$
- $1 \leq u_i, v_i \leq N$
- $1 \leq u, v \leq N$
### Sample 1:

```py
N, u, v = map(int, input().split())
graph = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
for _ in range(N - 1):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    graph[a].append(b)
    graph[b].append(a)
visited = [False] * (N + 1)
def dfs(node, distance):
    if node == v:
        return distance
    visited[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            result = dfs(neighbor, distance + 1)
            if result != -1:
                return result
    return -1
print(dfs(u, 0))
```
