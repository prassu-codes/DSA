# Third Maximum Number

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums`.

Return the  **third distinct maximum**  number in this array. If the third  **maximum**  does not exist, return the  **maximum**  number.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2.
The third distinct maximum is 1.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 2.
The second distinct maximum is 1.
The third distinct maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2 (both 2's are counted together since they have the same value).
The third distinct maximum is 1.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1

 

 **Follow up:**  Can you find an `O(n)` solution?

        if len(q)>2:
            return (q[-3])
        else:
            return (q[-1])
