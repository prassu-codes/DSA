## Problem

Given a positive integer `n`, find the sum of all integers in the range `[1, n]`  **inclusive**  that are divisible by `3`, `5`, or `7`.

Return  *an integer denoting the sum of all numbers in the given range satisfying the constraint.* 

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: n = 7
Output: 21
Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 7] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7. The sum of these numbers is 21.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 40
Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 10] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10. The sum of these numbers is 40.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: n = 9
Output: 30
Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 9] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9. The sum of these numbers is 30.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= n <= 103
