# Neither Minimum nor Maximum

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an integer array `nums` containing  **distinct**   **positive**  integers, find and return  **any**  number from the array that is neither the  **minimum**  nor the  **maximum**  value in the array, or  **`-1`**  if there is no such number.

Return  *the selected integer.* 

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: In this example, the minimum value is 1 and the maximum value is 4. Therefore, either 2 or 3 can be valid answers.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: Since there is no number in nums that is neither the maximum nor the minimum, we cannot select a number that satisfies the given condition. Therefore, there is no answer.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: nums = [2,1,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: Since 2 is neither the maximum nor the minimum value in nums, it is the only valid answer. 

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 100
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
- All values in nums are distinct

        if len(nums)<=2:
            return -1 
        else:
            nums.remove(min(nums))
            nums.remove(max(nums))
            return nums[0]
```
